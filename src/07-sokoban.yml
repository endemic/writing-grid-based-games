  [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) is yet another classic casual game genre. You control a player who must organize boxes by pushing them to certain locations. The difficulty is to not get a box stuck by pushing it against the wall or into a corner. As a kid, I played games with similar mechanics, such as [Rodent's Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent's_Revenge). These sorts of games are easily made with GridJS, as they limit movement to within a grid in each level. Let's go ahead and figure out how to make a basic sokoban game.

  As always, [download the GridJS source](https://github.com/endemic/gridjs/releases/latest), which has a `game.js` template file with some example code.

  1. Draw walls
  2. Draw player
  3. Player movement
  4. Draw boxes/goals
  5. Win condition/reset
