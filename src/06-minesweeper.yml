  One of the classic time-wasting games that lots of people have fond memories of is Minesweeper; particularly the [Microsoft version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper). Since it was included in Windows 3.1, it was one of those games that you could always count on when you might have access to an unfamiliar PC. Although, I have a personal confession: I always played Solitaire or Hearts, rather than Minesweeper. I never took the time to really learn how to play the game! Nevertheless, Minesweeper is a classic example of a grid-based game, and one that is a great candidate for re-implementing yourself.

  As far as the rules go, the game is actually pretty simple. You've got a grid, with randomly placed "mines." The mines are hidden by an overlay. Clicking one of the hidden grid cells will reveal what's underneath. If it's a mine, you lose. If it's a number, that means there are that many mines in the eight neighboring spaces. If it's blank, then all neighboring blank spaces are revealed. The gist is to try to reveal the game state by logically using the clues.

  ```
  [1][1][1][ ][ ]
  [1][*][2][ ][ ]
  [1][2][*][1][ ]
  [ ][1][1][2][1]
  [ ][ ][ ][1][*]
  ```

  ```javascript
  const init = () => {
    // change these values to make a larger/smaller game board
    const rows = 10;
    const columns = 10;

    // more mines == harder
    const mineCount = 10;

    Grid.init(rows, columns);

    // in this game we have two grids -- one to display the game board, and one for the mines/hints
    const mineState = Grid.fill(Grid.displayStateCopy, 'empty');

    // initialize the mines/hints board first
    let placedMines = 0;
    while (placedMines < mineCount) {
      // put mines randomly within the `mineState` array
      const {x, y} = Grid.randomPoint;

      if (mineState[x][y] === 'empty') {
        mineState[x][y] = 'mine';
        placedMines += 1;
      }
    }

    // Go through the `mineState` array a second time, in order
    // to insert numeric hint values; for each (x, y) position,
    // check the 8 surrounding grid cells
    for (let y = 0; y < rows; y += 1) {
      for (let x = 0; x < columns; x += 1) {

        // Skip cells that contain mines
        if (mineState[x][y] === 'mine') {
            continue;
        }

        // Find the number of mines contained in neighboring cells
        let hint = Grid.getNeighbors({ x, y })                           // gets all valid, in-bounds (x, y) positions of neighbors
                      .filter(({ x, y }) => mineState[x][y] === 'mine') // keep the (x, y) values that represent mines
                      .length;                                          // count how many there are

        // now we can display that number; represents how many mines surround the square
        mineState[x][y] = hint;
      }
    }

    // the game board will be initialized with all cells as "unknown", as the player hasn't revealed any cells yet
    const displayState = Grid.fill(Grid.displayStateCopy, 'unknown');

    // do initial update to show all cells as "unknown"
    Grid.update(displayState);

    // DEBUG -- this will display the contents of the mine/hint grid
    // Grid.update(mineState);

    Grid.onPointDown(onDown);
    Grid.onPointUp(onUp);

    // prevent right-click context menu on the game board
    document.querySelector('#grid').addEventListener('contextmenu', e => e.preventDefault());
  ```
